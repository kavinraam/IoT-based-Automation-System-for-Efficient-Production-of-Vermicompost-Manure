## Project Overview

This project introduces an **IoT-powered automation system** designed to optimize the production of **vermicompost manure**. Vermicompost is a nutrient-rich organic fertilizer created by the natural decomposition of organic waste using earthworms. Traditional composting methods require frequent human monitoring and manual intervention. This system solves these problems by automatically monitoring and maintaining ideal environmental conditions—such as **temperature, humidity, moisture level, and gas presence**—to improve compost quality and efficiency.

By leveraging IoT and cloud technologies, this solution provides **real-time data visualization**, **remote monitoring**, and **automated control** of compost conditions using sensors, actuators, and a Wi-Fi module.

## Key Objectives
- Automate the composting process using sensors and microcontrollers.
- Maintain ideal temperature and moisture levels with minimal human effort.
- Monitor the presence of hazardous gases during decomposition.
- Enable real-time data monitoring and alerting through cloud integration.
- Improve the quality and speed of vermicompost production.
